## 🔍 Projects Overview

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
**Objective:** Predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using features like age, gender, class, etc.

**Dataset:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

**Steps Involved:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (e.g., extracting titles from names)
- Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation

📊 **ML Algorithms Used:**  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest

### 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective:** Detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset using classification techniques.

**Dataset:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

**Steps Involved:**
- Handling imbalanced data using under/oversampling or SMOTE
- Correlation and feature selection
- Training classifiers to distinguish fraud from legitimate transactions
- Evaluating performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

📊 **ML Algorithms Used:**    
- Random Forest
